                                Amazon Web Services(AWS)
Defining AWS :
 AWS is a secure cloud service provider with many services to help businesses scale and grow. 


AWS Services
1. Compute Services
    --> Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud(EC2) : 
            We need raw compute capacity to host our applications & provide the compute power that our business needs.
            When we are working with aws those servers are virtual & the servers use to gain access to virtual servers 
            is called EC2.
            
            EC2 stands Elastic Compute Cloud : 
            Elastic : Elastic refers to increase or decrease size of existing servers.
            Compute : Compute refers to reason why most users run servers to host runnng applications or process data.
                    These actions require compute resources, including processing power (CPU) and memory (RAM).
            Cloud   : Cloud refers to the fact that the EC2 instances that you run are hosted in the cloud.

            Gives you full Control over guest OS either MicroSoft Windows or Linux on each instance.

            With Amazon EC2, you can launch any number of instances of any size into any Availability Zone anywhere 
            in the world in minutes. Instances launch from Amazon Machine Images (AMIs), which are effectively virtual 
            machine templates.

    --> Amazon Lightsail: 
        Amazon Lightsail is a lightweight cloud platform for a simple web application.
        Provides virtual private servers to run simple workloads in a cost-effective way.

    --> AWS Lambda:
        AWS Lambda is a service where we run the code without servers.
        Lambda is Serveless Service.
    --> AWS Batch : 
        AWS Batch is a service where we run hundreds of thousands of batch workloads.
    --> AWS Elastic Beanstalk : 
        AWS Elastic Beanstalk is a service that deploys, manages, and scales your web applications for you.
    --> AWS Outposts : 
        AWS Outposts is a service to run AWS infrastructure in your on-premises data center.
    --> AWS App Runner
    --> EC2 Image Builder 
    --> Serverless Application Repository
    --> AWS Simspace Weaver

2. Storage and Content Delivery Services:
   Storage Services :
    --> Amazon Simple Storage Service(Amazon S3):
        --> Amazon S3 is a service that provides object-level storage. Amazon S3 stores data as objects in buckets.
        --> The maximum file size for an object in Amazon S3 is 5TB.
        --> Web accessible object store (through API or HTTPS)
        --> Highly Durable (99.999999999% design)
        Types or Storage Classes of S3:
        --> S3 Standard
        --> S3 Intelligent-tiering 
        --> S3 Standard Infrequent Access(S3 Standard IA)
        --> S3 One Zone IA
        --> S3 Glacier 
        --> S3 Glacier Deep Archive 
    --> AWS Elatic File System(AWS EFS)
        Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) provides a simple, scalable, fully managed, elastic (Network File System) NFS storage.
        A network file system (NFS) enables you to store and retrieve data in a network.
    --> AWS Backup: 
        AWS Backup centrally manages and automates backups across AWS regions.
    --> Storage Gateway
    --> AWS Elastic Disaster Recovery

    --> Route 53:
            Scalable DNS and Domain Name Registration.
    --> Global Accelerator 
3. Databases :
    --> Amazon RDS: Amazon RDS is a managed database service that sets up and operates a relational database in the cloud.
    --> Amazon DynamoDB : Amazon DynamoDB is a NoSQL Database. Data is stored in tables with a flexible column structure.
    --> Amazon DocumentDB : Fully managed MongoDB-compatible database service.
    --> Amazon ElastiCache
